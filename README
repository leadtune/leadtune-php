BEFORE YOU BEGIN:

* Familiarize yourself with the LeadTune API: http://www.leadtune.com/api

* Learn what factors are and identify the ones relevant to your system http://www.leadtune.com/factors/overview

INSTALLATION:

* From your system's command line, enter the "test" directory and run the command "php LeadTuneProspects.php". 
  If this test completes successfully, then your system is able to interact with the LeadTune API. 

* Place LeadTuneProspect.php in your project's include_path

USAGE:

  Below is a simple example that demonstrates how to create and retrieve prospects.

  $ltp = new LeadTuneProspect(MY_ACCOUNT_USERNAME, MY_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD);

  /**
   * "organization", "event", and "email" are the minimum factors needed to create a prospect, 
   * but the more factors you provide, the more accurate the appraisals will be.
   */
  $prospect_created = $ltp->create(array("organization" => MY_ORGANIZATION_CODE, "event" => "lead_accepted", "email" => "wanna@learn.edu"));

  $prospect_retrieved = $ltp->read($prospect_created['prospect_id'], MY_ORGANIZATION_CODE);
